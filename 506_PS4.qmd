## Problem 1

### 1a:

```{r}
install.packages("nycflights13_1.0.2.tar.gz")
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# Data in this tibble
nycflights13::flights

# 1st: Departures
# Exclude those destinatios with under 10 flights:
flights_10_plus <- flights %>%
                    group_by(dest) %>%
                    filter(n() >= 10) %>%
                    summarise(flight_count = n()) %>%
                    arrange(flight_count) %>%
                    ungroup()
flights_10_plus
# 3 destinations with less than 10 flights, removed from this filtered list

# Summarize mean and median departure delays
flights_dep_stats <- flights %>%
                      group_by(dest) %>%
                        filter(n() >= 10) %>%
                      ungroup() %>%
                      group_by(origin) %>%
                        summarise(mean_dep_delay = round(mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 1),
                                  median_dep_delay = round(median(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 1)
                                  )%>%
                        arrange(desc(mean_dep_delay)) %>%
                      ungroup()

# Sanity check
row_count_origin <- flights %>% 
                    distinct(origin) # We're good!

# Display airport name and not code:

# Airport names is shown in this tibble: faa in airports has information that origin does
nycflights13::airports

airport_names <- flights_dep_stats %>%
                left_join(airports, join_by("origin" == "faa"))
```

```{r}
# Display results neatly:

# Departures tibble
departures <- flights_dep_stats %>%
              left_join(airports, join_by("origin" == "faa")) %>%
              select(name, mean_dep_delay, median_dep_delay)
#########################################################################

# Arrivals tibble: same process as above, just altogether since I know it works
arrivals <- flights %>%
            group_by(dest) %>%
              filter(n() >= 10) %>%
              summarise(mean_arr_delay = round(mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 1),
                        median_arr_delay = round(median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 1)) %>%
              arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay)) %>%
            ungroup() %>%
            left_join(airports, join_by("dest" == "faa")) %>%
            select(name, mean_arr_delay, median_arr_delay)
